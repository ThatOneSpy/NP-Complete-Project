    name: Brendan Hom
    Max 3-Sat Approximation Solution

    n: Number of variables.
    m: Number of clauses.

    Strategy Idea: 
        1. Randomization
        Assign random Boolean values to each variable.

        2. Incremental Improvement
        Iteratively flip the truth value of each variable one at a time. 
        After each flip, compute the new number of satisfied clauses.
        Retain the flip if it improves the solution; otherwise, revert the flip.

        3. Stopping Conditions
        The algorithm attempts to improve the solution incrementally over multiple iterations.
        It stops either when no further improvement is made after 5 consecutive iterations or 
        when all clauses are satisfied (best_count == m).

    Runtime:
    1. Initial random assignment: O(n)
    2. Checking satisfaction of all clauses after a flip: O(m)
    3. Flipping each variable iteratively: O(n * m)

    Time Complexity: O(n * m)
